<blockquote cite="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH#Notes"></blockquote> 
<p><span>p</span>H is a scale of acidity from 0 to 14. It tells how <abbr title="An acid is a substance that can donate a hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>) (generally speaking, this will be a proton) to another substance. Acids have a pH less than 7.0. A chemical can donate a proton if the hydrogen atom is attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen, nitrogen, or chlorine. Some acids are strong and others are weak. The weak acids hold on to some of their protons, while the strong acids let go of all of them. All acids will release hydrogen ions into solutions. The amount of ions that get released per molecule will determine if the acid is weak or strong. Weak acids are acids that partially release the hydrogen atoms that are attached. These acids, then, may lower pH by dissociation of hydrogen ions, but not completely. Weak acids generally have a pH value of 4-6 while strong acids have a pH value of 1 to 3.

    ">acidic</abbr> or <abbr title="In chemistry, an alkali is an aqueous solution with a pH value of more than 7. The word 'Alkali' comes from the Arabic 'qali' meaning 'from the ashes' since ashes mixed with water used as cleaning products are made of alkali materials.">alkaline</abbr> a substance is. More acidic solutions have lower pH. More alkaline solutions have higher pH. Substances that aren't acidic or alkaline (that is, neutral solutions) usually have a pH of 7. <abbr title="An acid is a substance that can donate a hydrogen ion (H+) (generally speaking, this will be a proton) to another substance.

<p>pH is a measure of the concentration of <abbr title="A proton is part of an atom. They are found in the nucleus of an atom along with neutrons. The periodic table groups atoms according to how many protons they have. A single atom of hydrogen is made up of an electron moving around a proton. Most of the mass of this atom is in the proton, which is ">protons</abbr> (H<sup>+</sup>) in a solution. S.P.L. Sørensen introduced this concept in the year 1909. The p stands for the German potenz, meaning power or concentration, and the H for the hydrogen <abbr title="An ion is an electrically charged atom or molecule. It is "charged" so it will move near electricity. Atoms are made from positively charged protons, negatively charged electrons, and uncharged neutrons. Ions are charged because they have an unequal number of protons and electrons.">ion</abbr> (H<sup>+</sup>).</p>

<p>The most common formula for calculating pH is:</p>
<p>pH=-log<sub>10</sub>[H<sup>+</sup>]</p>
<p>[H<sup>+</sup>] indicates the concentration of H+ ions (also written [H3O<sup>+</sup>],the equal concentration of hydronium ions), measured in moles per litre (also known as molarity).</p>
<p>However, the correct equation is actually:</p>
<p>pH=-log<sub>10</sub>[a<sub>H+</sub>]</p>

<p>where a<sub>H+</sub> indicates the activity of H+ ions. But, this equation in most cases provides the same value as the more common formula, so in introductory chemistry the previous equation is given as the definition of pH.</p>
<p>Most <abbr title="Most substances have a pH in the range of 0 to 14, although extremely acidic or alkaline substances may have pH < 0, or pH > 14.">substances</abbr> have a pH in the range of 0 to 14, although extremely acidic or alkaline substances may have pH < 0, or pH > 14.</p>
<p>Alkaline substances have, instead of hydrogen ions, a concentration of hydroxide ions (OH<sup>-</sup>).</p>
<h2 class="head">pH indicators:</h2>
<p>Certain dyes change colour depending on whether they are in an acid solution or an alkaline solution . pH indicator is a chemical compound added in small amounts to a solution so the pH (acidity or basicity) of the solution can be seen. The pH indicator is a chemical detector for hydronium ions (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>) or hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>). Normally, the indicator causes the colour of the solution to change depending on the pH.</p>
<p>Typical indicators are phenolphthalein, methyl orange, methyl red, bromothymol blue, and thymol blue. They each change colour at different points on the pH scale, and can be used together as a universal indicator.</p>
<p>Another way is to use litmus paper, which is based on a natural pH indicators. The paper can tell you how strong the chemical is, whether it is a stronger acid or a stronger base.</p>
